This project is run on a Jupyter notebook from an Anaconda distribution. This provides an easy way to manage and run python scripts.
To manage software version compatibility, we recommend using the software listed below.

1. This application requires three files to function as developed:
	a. Main.ipynb – This is the Jupyter Notebook file that holds the source code.
	b. requirements.txt – Contains a list of all the required Python packages needed to run the application.
	c. cbbAll.csv – Contains the dataset.
2. The Anaconda distribution we used during development was Anaconda3-2022.10-Windows-x86_64.exe. To download this distribution, go to https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/. This will work for Windows 10/11 and Windows Server 2019-2022. For other Operating Systems, pick an installer from the same date. This distribution comes with Python version 3.9, which will work with the other required Python packages used in the project.
